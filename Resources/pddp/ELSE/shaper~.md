[shaper~] performs waveshaping with transfer functions, in which signal input values (from -1 to 1) are mapped to the the transfer function's indexes. Values outside the -1 to 1 range are wrapped inside it.
You can set an array for [shaper~], as in this example, or use its internal transfer function for chebyshev polinomials.
