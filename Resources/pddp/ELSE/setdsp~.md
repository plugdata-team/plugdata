[setdsp~] is a convenient abstraction to display and set Pd's audio engine (aka 'DSP') state. You can just click on it to change it to On/Off via its toggle interface. This object is commonly found in the documentation of the ELSE library audio objects, at the top right corner.
By default, the [setdsp~] object will check the current DSP state and load accordingly (on or off). But you can give it an argument to set it on/off.
