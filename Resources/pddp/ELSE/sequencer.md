[sequencer] sends an element from a given sequence when banged. Elements joined by "-" are sent at the same time but separately (allowing chords). A single "-" is treated as a rest. A "_" is ignored and can be thought as "tie". A "|" represents a barline. Symbol elements are sent without a symbol selector (and can be note names or anything else). A "bang" comes out as a proper "bang".
