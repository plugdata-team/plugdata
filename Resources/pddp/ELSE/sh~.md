[sh~] samples and holds a value from the left inlet. In "gate" mode (default), values are sampled if the signal in the right inlet is greater than the threshold (0 by default), or held if lesser or equal to it. In "trigger" mode, the value needs to fall below the threshold before it can retrigger [sh~]. A bang also triggers it.
