[click~] generates an impulse when receiving a bang. An impulse is a single sample with a value of one followed by zeros, and this is the default impulse generated by [click~], but you can can also an impulse with a different amplitude value or even as a list of values (for band limited impulses - maximum is 256 sample values).
