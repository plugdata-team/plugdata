    description: 1st element is an int address to store remaining data to
outlets:
  1st:

methods:
  - type: assoc <symbol, int>

[coll] stores/edits any messages at given addresses (an integer or a symbol). If an input list starts with an int, it stores the other element(s) at that int address.
