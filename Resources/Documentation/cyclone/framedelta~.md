The [framedelta~] object was designed specially to compute a running phase deviation of a FFT analysis by subtracting values in each position of its previously received signal block from the current signal block. When used in a FFT subpatch, it can keep a running phase deviation of the FFT because the FFT size is equal to the block size.
