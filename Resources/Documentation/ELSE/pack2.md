[pack2] is kinda similar to Pd Vanilla's [pack], but any inlet triggers the output (though a "set" message avoids the output). It can also initialize a symbol value and it doesn't create a list selector for you. Moreover, you can change many elements with a list message and an element that was initialized as a float can become a symbol and vice versa.
