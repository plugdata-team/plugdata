    description: gate: on/attack (non-0) or off/release (0)
  - type: bang
    description: attacks the envelope with the last gate on value
  - type: list
    description: sets and runs envelope (pairs of duration & target. if odd, 1st float is starting point)

[envgen~] is an envelope (and an all purpose line) generator (here it creates a 1000 ms line to 1 and 500 ms line to 0).
