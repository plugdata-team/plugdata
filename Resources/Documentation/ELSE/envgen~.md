arguments:
- type: list
  description: <f> â€” initial output value, <f,f,..> sets the envelope
  default: 0 0

inlets:
  1st:
  - type: float/signal
    description: gate: on/attack (non-0) or off/release (0)
  - type: bang
    description: attacks the envelope with the last gate on value
  - type: list
    description: sets and runs envelope (pairs of duration & target. if odd, 1st float is starting point)
  2nd:
  - type: list
    description: sets the envelope and doesn't run it

  - type: float
    description: status: 1 <on>, 0 <off>

flags:
  - name: -exp <list>

  - type: expi <f, f>
    description: sets an exponential for a line segment specified by the first float indexed from 0

[envgen~] is an envelope (and an all purpose line) generator (here it creates a 1000 ms line to 1 and 500 ms line to 0).
