----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0-0 Release Candidate 4:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**LIBRARY:**

Breaking changes:
- swapped rightmost inlets for [polymetro] and [polymetro~] (they were in a different order than the arguments)

- [bicoeff] renamed to [bicoeff2] since [bicoeff] is now a new GUI object.
- Replaced some band limited oscillators abstractions for compiled objects that are backwards compatible, more efficient, but hey, they sound different and produce different waveforms. They are: [bl.tri~], [bl.square~], [bl.saw~], [bl.saw2~] and [bl.vsaw~].
- [sysrt.out] added new 2nd "tick" outlet.
- rint/floor/ceil: removed 2nd inlet and bang/set methods
- free.rev~: decay parameter is now mapped differently internally
- Objects with random number generators now have a unique seed based on system time, this is more of an improvement than a breaking change. The pseudo random generator algorithm has also been unified. Now all objects have a 'seed' method and a seed flag. I lost track which objects break in this change. Some objects did not even have this and now have. These objects are: brown, brown~, chance, chance~, drunkard, drunkard~, dust~, dust2~, gray~, lfnoise, lfnoise~, markov, perlin, pink~, rampnoise, rampnoise~, rand.f, rand.f~, rand.i, rand.i~, rand.list, rand.seq, randpulse, randpulse~, randpulse2, randpulse~, stepnoise, stepnoise~, tempo, tempo~, white~

---------

Breaking changes:
- [pluck~] swapped first two inlets

- standardized messages: [sample~], [rec], [score] and [score2] now have "open"/"save" (like other objects in ELSE) instead of read/write and "load". Show/hide is now used instead of open/close in [presets], [score]/[score2], [stack]/[store].

Enhancements/fixes:
- [eqdiv] fixed resolution issue.
- fixed memory crash in [args].
- fixed [shaper~] freezing pd on windows.
- [pluck~] added float and bang method for control triggering. Changed internal filter to a 1 pole filter (this is like the new [lop2~] object and arguably another breaking change). General efficiency improved.
- improved efficiency for friendly 2nd order filters (highpass~/lowpass~, etc).
- fixed memory leaks for a few objects ([chance~], [fdn.rev~], [match~], [rotate~], [spread~], [xgate~] & [xselect~])

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0-0 Release Candidate 1:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

LIBRARY:
---------

Breaking changes:
- FLAGS now should come first!!! This was a major issue in ELSE, where it allows flags after arguments and this is not how flags work in Pd Vanilla, so this has finally been fixed but it breaks the majority of the following affected objects: count, grain.live~, grain.sampler~, grain.synth~, gran.player~, pvoc.player~, bpbank~, oscbank~, oscbank2~, resonbank~, resonbank2~, function~, envgen~, sample~, rec.file~, play.file~, player~, adsr~, asr~, allpass.2nd~, autotune, bandpass~, bandstop~, bend.in/out, cents2frac, chance, clock, comb.filt~, dec2frac, deg2rad, del~, dir, drive~, drunkard/drunkard~, duck~, envelope~, eq~, fbdelay~, ffdelay~, flanger~, glide / glide2 /  glide~ / glide2~, group, highpass~, impulse, interpolate, iterate, lfo, lb, loop, lowpass~, merge, metronome, midi, mono, morph, mov.avg~, mov.rms~, noisegate~, norm~, note.in, note.out, openfile, out1~, pattern, phasor, peak~, pimp, pitch2note, pluck~, presets, pulse, quantizer/quantizer~, rad2deg, ramp~, rescale / rescale~, resonant~, retune, rms~, scales, sh~, shaper~, s2f~, slew / slew2, suspedal, tabplayer~, tabwriter~, touch.in, touch.out, unmerge, voices, xmod~, vocoder~

- [function~]/[envgen~]: '-exp' flag/message is now different and a new 'expl' message has the old behaviour.
- [tempo]/[tempo~]: 'div' parameter renamed to 'mul' (which does not affect immediately in [tempo~] anymore but waits the next bang as in [metro]). No more 'mode' settings in [tempo] and now the default mode is "immediate". These changes make the objects consistent to each other and to other objects in ELSE. 
- [oscilloscope~]: renamed to [oscope~].
- [trigger2]: object removed.
- [pimp]: default grain is 5ms, resetting phase to 0/1 doesn't bang anymore.
- [metronome]: new design with different outlets.
- [clock]: multiplier parameter is an actual frequency multiplier instead of divider (so it's the opposite now, where '2' is twice as fast instead of twice as slow; this is better for tuplets/polyrhythms by the way).
- [envgen~]: probably fixed some crashing bug, but reduced the number of maximum segments to 64!

Enhancements/fixes:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 36

- [gran.player~] inserted a 2nd inlet so it's consistent to [stretch.shift~]
- [tabplayer~] range message is now proportional (from 0-1) instead of ms.
- Reverted changes from beta 31 in random generators. Now seeds are back to the way it was before, so we do not have a different seed every time we open Pd.

- [player~] fixed loading args correctly, added sample rate correction, fade/xfade methods and flags for missing parameters.
- [limit] now works properly, it was really malfunctioning. New 2nd argument sets to "ignore" mode. This is also now a compiled object.
- [chance] now you can change the number of chances via messages.
- [message] fixed dealing with anything messages of only one element. 
- [circle] fixed loading size argument. 
- 10 new objects for a total of 393: [grain.synth~], [grain.sampler~], [grain.live~], [rdelay~], [autotune], [autotune2], [retune], [eqdiv], [midi2freq] and [frac2ratio].

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 35

Breaking changes:
- [moses~] object deleted (that was just stupid, right?)
- [setmess] object deleted (use the new [insert] object instead)
- [coin]/[coin~] objects deleted (use the new [chance]/[chance~] objects instead now)
- [plate.rev~] not a real issue I hope, but now we have some default parameters other than 0.

Enhancements/fixes:
- [mono] fixed input bug, now picthes need to be >= 0, otherwise it's ignored
- [routeall] new right inlet sets element to match to
- [bangdiv] new right outlet bangs when there is a rest

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 34

Breaking changes:
- [tabplayer~]: changed the purpose of 'start' message, a new 'play' message handles what start did.
- [player~] also has some method changes like 'play' instead of start (and is now based on tabplayer~).
- [lfo] vsaw now has width from 0 to 1 as vsaw~

Changes:
- [note] has 'Menlo' as the default font for mac, since this is the default font for mac in Pd in 0.51-3
 
Improvements/fixes:
- [tabplayer~]: several new methods and fixed a bug with banging when finished playing.
- [player~]: is now based on [tabplayer~] and has no issues reading very large files.
- [pvoc.player~] & [gran.player~]: fixed several range and loop issues.
- [sample~]: new info method.

- [sequencer]: float now outputs value.
- [sequencer~]: float method removed, it is now a "goto" message.
- [pic]: set message removed.

Improvements/fixes:
- [drum.seq]: fixed crashing at creation. Added goto message and bang method.
- [sequencer] now allows symbols/bangs as elements, and a new "-" syntax joins elements together or represents a pause. A new 'goto' message sets index but doesn't output as the float method used to.
- [nbang] now allows '0' bangs.
- Fixed all band limited oscillators.
- [lastvalue] has lots new functionalities, like setting to 'none', which prevents output when first value is received.
- [stack]: new store method/flag, dump method and now clicking the object opens window. Fixed a bug where you always had "list" selector displayed.
- [midi] new dump method.
- 1 new object for a total of 380: [combine] 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 32


Breaking changes:
- [note]: changed some method/flag names.
- [separate]: now elements that look like floats are converted to floats / separator method has been removed in favor of a secondary inlet (this now makes it compliant to a new counterpart object named [unite]).
- [colors]: you must now specify "iemgui" instead of "gui", and default output is now 'hexadecimal'
- [else]: now it won't add else's path anymore to preference's path, so you must now load else via preferences => path or [declare -path else]. You can still load else in startup to print the library version.

Improvements/fixes:
- Fixed issues that prevented ELSE from being compiled inside Camomile (which turns pd patches into plugins). 
- Lots of random objects now have a unique seed value based on system time. Objects affected: rand.f/rand.f~/rand.i/rand.i~/rampnoise/rampnoise~/stepnoise/stepnoise~/lfnoise/lfnoise~.
- [drum.seq]: fixed embedding sequence values. 
- [note]: several new methods and graphical improvements as well as a properties window (this is basically stolen from cyclone's comment). Improved GOP, fixed loading receive symbol arg without making Pd asking to save changes. 
- [separate]: added an "empty" separator that separates all characters from the symbol. 
- virtually all abstractions: now it's possible to create them and load them correctly via dynamic patching. 
- improved GOP visibility for GUI objects: keyboard, pad, button & function. 
- [canvas.edit]/[canvas.zoom]/[fontsize]: added a a bang method to query for status. 
- [spectrograph~]: added a hann window and fixed a bug related to setting parameters via messages and also another bug with the -db and -log flags. Added a rate parameter and the possibility to graph via bangs.

- [unmerge]: fixed outlet order (now is right to left). 
- [rotate~]: added a 2nd argument for position. 
- [player~]: added a float argument to the start message to set a staring point in ms. 
- [gain~]/[gain2~]: fixed set method, added init option, bang method to mute/unmute, added flags for all parameters and now pd asks you if you want to save changes. 
- [canvas.edit]: now also detects getting into edit mode via "select all" (also true for compiled GUI objects that react to getting in and out of edit mode: keyboard/pad/pic/function/button). 
- 3 new objects for a total of 379: [unite], [symbol2any] and [oscilloscope~] (basically stolen from cyclone).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 31

Breaking changes:
- [xgate~] & [xselect~]: Removed linear crossfade option, instead of adding this option to all the other objects that were similar, it was decided just not to support this option, as it doesn't seem the best option.
- [rec~] renamed to [tabwriter~], so it's related to [tabwrite~] and [tabplayer~]. Design has changed as well.

Non breaking changes:
- [mono.rev~] and [stereo.rev~]: Default wet values is now "0.5". 
- [rec.file~]: minimum fade is now 0 ms. 
- [pvoc.live~]: 1st buffer size argument is not obligatory anymore, default is 5000ms. 
- [stretch.shift~~]: 1st argument default is now 5000ms like in [pvoc.live~]. 

Improvements/fixes:
- [else]: fixed Pd version check (minimum should have been 0.51-1, not 0.51-0). 
- [tempo] & [tempo~]: added 'hz' time measure and messages with more than one item (like 'ms 100') now sets other parameters. 
- [function]: improvements on drawing instructions, don't draw if it should not be visible. Now inlet/outlets are only shown if in edit mode and if no send/receive symbol are given.
- [tabplayer~]: fixed -loop flag. 
- [slider2d]: init message fixed. 
- [circle] & [slider2d]: Now these can be used in a GOP (Graph On Parent) buried more than one level of depth (this means it can be used anywhere) - this is thanks to a new implementation based on the new [pad] object. 
- [button]: this is now a compiled object and can now be used inside GOP (in any depth level). You can set colors and different dimension sizes for x/y axis. 
- 3 new objects for a total of 376: [pad], [perlin~] and [batch.write~].

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 30

Breaking changes:
- [dollarzero] renamed to [dollsym] as the name was just plain wrong as it also expands any dollar sign symbols (bang method was also removed).
- [messbox]: clear message remove, just use 'set' instead.
- [rec.file~]: leftmost inlet now takes control messages, this makes it more compliant to other similar objects in the library (as [rec~] and [autofade~]).

Improvements/fixes:
- [else]: fixed version checking (it would complain if you upgrade to newer versions of Pd)
- [sample~]: fixed loading arguments
- [play.file~] and [sample]: fixed a bug where they couldn't load files that didn't exist by the time they were created.
- [display] now resizes better for non-fixed size setting with characters like "ç" and "ã", but still doesn't work well for other foreign alphabets like katakana and stuff. Instead of an abstraction, I should probably write an actual GUI compiled external for this and [display~] soonish.
- 3 new objects for a total of 372: [batch.rec~], [tabplayer~] and [fontsize] 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 29

Breaking changes:
- deleted [fromany] and [toany] objects. These were requested by Liam Goodrace for his "Context Sequencer", but not even him can tell me anymore why this is/was needed. I think it's obsolete and unnecessary and offer no real substantial advantage to [list from/tosymbol]. If anyone actually needed this for any reason, let me know...  
- [keyboard] - behaviour changed a bit: now, by default, the velocity value depends on where you click on the vertical axis. You can set a normalized value if you want.
- [pic] deleted 'bang' method.
- [makesymbol] renamed to [format] and behaviour also changed: now it outputs anythings instead of symbols, bang method was removed from secondary inlets, variable arguments are mandatory for the object to output values (errors are given otherwise). You can still generate symbols as [makesymbol] used to (see help file for details).
- [drum.seq] the 'export' message now outputs a list preceded by "export", which shall avoid issues and make it easier to manage/route.

Improvements/fixes:
- [dir]: now you can open absolute paths in windows, which was never possible before (yikes).
- keyboard: Now velocities can be set depending where you click, there's a normalization method, and you can also toggle keys by pressing "shift". Also added send/receive symbols, and inlets/outlet are drawn when in edit mode. Now we have a checkbutton (toggle) in the properties where pertinent. You should also now use flags instead of arguments. There are also many improvements to the code and other minor fixes. 
- [pic]: Fixed a bug in the properties window where you couldn't set "report size". Improved management of special characters in properties window (now you don't need to escape them anymore, for instance). Now we have a checkbutton (toggle) in the properties where pertinent, plus other minor improvements to the code.
- [any2symbol] added new inlet/argument to set a new separator character.
- [drunkard~]: added secondary inlets to set lower and upper bounds.
- [routeall] fixed/improved routing for anythings.
- 1 new object for a total of 370: [messbox] 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 28

Breaking changes:
- With the new feature of inlet~ where it can take control messages (as of Pd 0.51), several objects had their inlet messages changed. 29 objects affected: [bin.shift~], [bpbank], [compress~], [conv~], [drunkard~], [duck~], [free.rev~], [freeze~], [gain~], [gain2~], [graph~], [mix2~], [mix4~], [mono.rev~], [oscbank~], [out~], [out1~], [out4~], [out8~], [phaser~], [plate.rev~], [pvoc.freeze~], [pvoc.live~], [resonbank~], [resonbank2~], [spectrograph~], [stereo.rev~], [stretch.shift~] & [vocoder~] 
- [savechange] object deleted (using something based on [canvas.setname] for what that other object did now).


Improvements/fixes:
- The ELSE library now is accompanied by the Live Electronics Tutorial by Alexandre Torres Porres as a single download combo.
- The ELSE library now should be loaded as a binary pack because of a new "else" binary. This allows the ELSE library to be loaded as a regular lib, via Startup, or using [declare -lib else]. The binary can also be loaded as an object, which outputs version and information about the library.
- With the new feature of inlet~ where it can take arguments, several objects got improvements. 11 objects affected: [allpass.filt~], [bl.imp~], [bl.imp2~], [bl.saw~], [bl.saw2~], [bl.sine~], [bl.square~], [bl.tri~], [bl.vsaw~], [bl.wavetable~] & [crusher~].
- [keyboard]: many improvements to the code (basically a rewrite from scratch). Implemented zooming. Finally implemented the toggle mode and added a flush message. Improved/fixed the way it was detecting the click on the right keys. Fixed clicking in Graph on Parent. Now the object asks you if you want to save changes after changing parameters from messages, plus other minor fixes.
- [slider2d] and [cricle] are now usable in an abstraction or GOP subpatch, but only as deep as only one layer of encapsulation.
- [avg]: fixed "clear" message.
- [nyquist~]: wasn't creating in linux.
- [graph~]: added an outlet for the input signal come out to.
- [dir]: fixed a bug where it printed an annoying error on windows.

- [pic]: added "set" and "size" methods - included an example on how to use [canvas.zoom] for emulating a zoom.
- fixed peak estimation for [peak~], [vu~], [meter~], [meter2~], [meter4~] and [meter8~].
- Now [spectrograph~], [graph~], [range.hsl], [drum.seq], [mtx.ctl] and [button] will properly ask if you want to save changes on parent patch.
- 6 new objects for a total of 371: [else], [canvas.bounds], [canvas.pos], [canvas.gop], [canvas.zoom] & [canvas.setname].

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- added ZOOM support for [canvas.mouse], also added zero and reset methods. Fixed the output order of outlets!
- [slider2d] and [circle]: improved efficiency by including the [limit] object. Fixed the way [savechange] was being used. Because of the ZOOM support in [canvas.mouse], these objects also now work properly in ZOOM mode!
- [circle]: improved mouse interaction, added bgcolor and 'no-clip' mode.
- [range.hsl]: improved a bit; management when in ZOOM (still has known issues).
- [function] & [note]: added 'dirty' flag for when things changed so it asks you if you wanna save it.
- [function]: Implemented ZOOM capability! Fixed outline color of dots to foreground's (it was always black), fixed a bug where setting receive name repeatedly made the object disappear.
- [pic]: fixed and improved many things, the image now is properly adjusted to the objects's coordinate; object now asks if you want to save changes; now clicking on it sends a bang; added send/receive symbols; added outline mode; now when you're in edit mode you can see an outline and the inlet/outlet; Implemented ZOOM capability (but this doesn't mean the picture gets zoomed); there's also a handy properties windows now! 
- 2 new objects for a total of 366 (228 signal and 138 control objects): [canvas.edit], [canvas.vis]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [canvas.mouse] is now not responsive while in 'edit mode' ([mouse] still is)
- [window] renamed to [canvas.active]

Improvements/fixes:
- [slider2d]: included send/receive names, independent x/y sizes, an option to hide coordinate lines, a grid option, colors for background and foreground, an 'init' option, a steady mode (default [jump on click now setable]), shift key now offers fine tuning, new [savechange] object offers a better management of saving changes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 21

Breaking changes:

Improvements/fixes:
- [loop] - new float inlet set number of iterations. 
- [mtx.ctl] - New import/export/flush methods. Improvements under the hood. It can now keep/save its parameters as regular GUIs do. A new embed method saves the contents within the object.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 3

the ar~ object has been renamed to asr~ cause that's what makes sense
the fbcomb~ object has been deleted, it's functionality is now the default one in the already existing fbdelay~ object, and it's older functionality is now an extra option.
the apass~ object has been renamed to allpass.rev~ and has an extra functionality for a gain coefficient, just like in fbdelay~
the apass~ object has been renamed to allpass.2nd~
brickwall~ is now a 10th order filter
added "magic" baheviour to [fbsine~] and swapped the rightmost inlets
the oscbak~ object is now oscbank2~ and there is a new oscbank~ object
new plateverb~ object
