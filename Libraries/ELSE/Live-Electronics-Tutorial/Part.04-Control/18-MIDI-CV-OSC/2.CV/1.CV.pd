#X text 44 70 Before MIDI \, analog synthesizers used (and still use) "Control Voltage" (CV) \, which is the same as to say they’re controlled by audio signals \, since audio output is nothing but an alternate voltage current., f 64;
#X text 44 136 There are 3 different types of control with CV: Triggers \, gates and a proper CV control that depends on the continuous variation of the voltage value., f 64;

#X text 44 189 In ELSE \, both an impulse or pulse can be considered a trigger \, but in the modular world \, a trigger is mostly an impulse \, which acts like a 'bang' and fires a process like playing a sample \, changing the value of a sequence or triggering a timed envelope. A gate is an on/off switch \, just like a toggle - that is a pulse. The proper ‘CV’ is just the process of controlling any parameter with a voltage value \, much like controlling anything in Pd with an audio signal \, but bound to the voltage range in the modular system instead. Let's check object that are relative to these 3 types of control here in Pd., f 64;
