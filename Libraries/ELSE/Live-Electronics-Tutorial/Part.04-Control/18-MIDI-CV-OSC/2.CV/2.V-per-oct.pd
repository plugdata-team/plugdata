#X text 22 397 The audible signal range in Pure Data is composed of amplitude values from -1 to 1 and we can use it to send CV to analog gear. Conversely \, we can receive CV from an external source in this -1 to 1 range. You need special hardware for this which is used to calibrate digital audio to the CV range used in your modular system. It could \, for instance \, correspond to a -5V to +5V range \, or a 0V to +10V instead \, both of which are very common., f 65;

#X text 22 24 A "CV" control depends on a voltage range used by a given module \, but there’s no single standard for this. You can have +/- 5v as a usual standard for AC (alternate current) \, also called ‘bipolar’ signal \, but unipolar standards also exists \, with different possible values \, such as from 0 to +5v \, 0 to +8v and 0 to +10v., f 65;
#X text 22 107 A safe bet is that you’ll never see a control voltage signal lower than -10 volts or higher than +10 volts and that’s because of the limitations of the power supply standard. Trigger and gate/pulses jump from 0 to a positive extreme \, so modules will usually respond to impulse/gate values of +5v. What the CV controls in terms of absolute values is always dependant on the module itself. This is quite different than in Pd where you can use a signal with a very specific value like '100' to control the attack phase of an envelope in ms. If you’re using CV to control the attack value of a module you have to tune it by ear. Usually you have a knob in the module to set the amount of CV that is controlling the parameter., f 65;
#X text 22 290 When it comes to control the frequency of an oscillator \, there’s also no standard and no way to know what a specific voltage value represents in terms of frequency. You usually calibrate and have a knob to tune your oscillator at a reference voltage value. The only golden rule and standard is that a change of 1 volt is a shift in one octave. Hence \, 0.5 is half an octave (a tritone) \, 2V is two octaves and so on., f 65;
#X text 22 507 The peak to peak amplitude in both cases is "10" \, which means you can have 10 octaves. This is more than good enough. The piano has 8 octaves \, for instance. If you start at 20 Hz \, you have 20.48 Khz 10 octaves above \, so it even exceedes a bit the ideal audible range of humans. The MIDI range \, by the way \, has a range of 10 octaves plus a 5th (from 0 to 127)., f 65;
#X text 509 60 Let's consider a reference pitch of middle C (C4) to 0 volts and use a CV value of -5v to 5v to transpose this pitch. This means it goes down 5 octaves and up 5 octaves \, so the range is from C-1 to C9. In MIDI \, this is from 0 to 120! Now let's consider the -1 to 1 digital signal as the -5v to +5V range. The patch below makes such a conversion., f 61;
#X text 593 204 -1 to 1;
#X text 593 269 Volts (-5 to 5);
#X text 578 370 reference (Middle C);
#X text 765 350 or...;
#X text 532 505 The above is some sort of conversion from "CV" to MIDI \, let's look a bit more into it in the next example. You may also realize that V/oct (Vots per octave) is a measure of octaves and relates to values in cents. Since "1" is an octave it has 1200 cents and you can convert cents to V/oct by dividing by 1200!;
