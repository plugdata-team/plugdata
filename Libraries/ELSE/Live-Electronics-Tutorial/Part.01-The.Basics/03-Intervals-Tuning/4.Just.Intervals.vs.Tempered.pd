#X text 25 24 Just Intervals are represented by the ratio of integers.
In other words \, they are rational numbers. On the other hand \, a
tempered interval such as the tritone (whose proportion is the square
root of two) cannot be represented by an integer ratio \, and is therefore
an irrational number., f 59;

#X text 25 102 Just Intervals relate to the Harmonic Series \, which
is a series of integers that represent the ratio of harmonics. This
implies that all harmonics are multiples of a fundamental tone., f

#X text 25 165 As an example \, the just interval obtained with the
3/2 ratio is that of a Just Perfect Fifth \, and corresponds to the
relationship between the third and second elements in the harmonic
series., f 59;
#X text 25 228 Now we can compare this interval with the one from the
equal temperament. See the default values to the right \, we load a
3/2 ratio and see that it has about 702 cents. A perfect fifth in the
equal temperament has 7 semitones and 700 cents. So we see a tiny difference
where the just intonation interval is almost only 2 cents higher.,
f 59;
#X text 25 320 Again \, what's more interesting about cents \, is being
able to compare intervals to the equal temperament. Try now other just
interval ratios such as major third (5/4) \, perfect fourth (4/3) \,
minor seventh (7/4) and others. Note that if you invert the ratio \,
you get the same interval but with a negative value in cents. For example
\, 2/3 is a fifth below. Note also how in such cases the ratio is below
