#X text 25 43 Setting a maximum value of 0 dB is a practice that comes
from the usage of "Volume Meters" (VU) in analog audio. This device
is calibrated so that 0 dB is the maximum value it can handle without
distorting. In digital audio we have the same thing \, but digital
distortion is a special type \, known as "clipping"., f 66;

#X text 26 131 The maximum peak amplitude is 1 (0 dBFS). Greater values
are "clipped" \, which means they become 1 as that's the maximum representable
value. In practice \, we have resulting waves that are a bit square
(see below the graphical representation of clipping \, with the [clip~]
object and [graph~])., f 66;

#X text 516 172 See below to the left how [vu] can still represent
values over 0 dB \, but note also how they become red \, as a sign
of "DANGER"! Or "warning \, this is being clipped"., f 66;
#X text 516 64 Within Pd we can still have values outside the -1 to
1 range. It is in the digital to analog conversion that the clipping
occurs. Pd has a native [vu] GUI object that is a kind of VU Meter. It displays RMS and Peak amplitudes \, but it doesn't really perform
any signal analysis. Now the [vu~] object from ELSE analyses a signal
and outputs both RMS (left outlet) and Peak (right outlet) so we can
feed [vu]., f 66;
#X text 516 225 Below \, to the right \, we have other objects from
ELSE: [meter~] and [meter2~] \, which are convenient abstractions based
on [vu~] and [vu] that automatically performs analysis on the input
signals. ELSE also offers [meter4~] and [meter8~] \, which can be used
for quadraphonic and octaphonic setups., f 66;
