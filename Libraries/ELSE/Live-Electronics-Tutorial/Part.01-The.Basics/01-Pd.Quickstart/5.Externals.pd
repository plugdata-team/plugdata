#X text 26 536 The order of the user added paths matter \, as the search
is prioritized to the first ones. You may have many installed libraries
where different externals can have the same name. Using [declare] forces
a priority over the user added paths and can help you control that.

#X text 26 269 Compiled external libraries come either as a single
binary pack (the "classic" library format) or as a set of separate
binaries. Single binary packs need to be loaded via the startup tab
(Preferences => Startup) and the second type only needs you to add
the library's folder to the search paths (in Preferences => Path).
'Deken' has a preference tabs where you can opt to be prompted if you
want to add a library to the paths after it's downloaded (sometimes
you don't want it \, like when it's a single binary pack)., f 65;
#X text 26 612 If you haven't already \, please download the "ELSE"
library that is needed for this tutorial and widely used from this
point onward. You can use 'deken' for it., f 65;

#X obj 571 300 declare -path else;
#X text 527 332 ELSE comes with separate binaries \, so you could add
else's folder to the user added search paths. Alternatively \, you
can use [declare -path else] \, which is what we do here in the examples
of this tutorial. Another alternative is to use relative paths \, such
as:;
#X text 24 18 The main Pd distribution is also known as "Pd Vanilla"
and comes without pre installed external libraries \, unlike other
"flavors" or forks. But techically speaking \, an external is any object
not part of Pd's binary. Therefore \, Pd Vanilla itself includes some
externals in a folder called "extra" (a.k.a the "extra library") inside
its application. This folder is searched automatically by the way \,
so these objects are found. Below we have some of these objects \,
like [sigmund~]. Abstractions are also externals and Pd has some
of those in the "extra" library \, like the reverb objects below.,
f 65;
#X text 26 192 Via the "Help => Find Externals" menu \, you can use
Pd's externals manager (a.k.a the 'Deken' plugin) to search for an
external or library name (such as "else") and download it. It's usual
and advised to download them to "~/Documents/Pd/externals" (Pd's externals
folder by default)., f 65;
#X text 26 402 The [declare] object is an alternative to load both
kinds of libraries and only loads them when the patch with a [declare]
object is loaded. So it's not a permanent install like adding to the
Path/Startup. But note that once a binary is loaded \, you can recreate
it on another patch even if it doesn't contain a [declare] object.
Also note that a single binary pack loads many objects at once \, so
you can create any object from the library even in another patch that
has no [declare] object and even if that particular object had not
been created before., f 65;
#X text 519 20 Actually \, ELSE downloaded via deken already includes
this tutorial and this is what you should have done. You can find installing
information on this tutorial's readme. Check also ELSE's repository
on github. Click on the bang buttons below to open them.;
#X text 525 164 Note you can also download and install else directly
from its repository (which contains all previous versions) manually.
, f 58;
#X text 526 218 If no objects below are shown \, then you hadn't downloaded
ELSE when you opened this patch. So download it and reload the patch
so you can instantiate [sine~] and [pluck~]. Here's how to use [declare]
to load its objects.;
