#X text 70 23 In Pd we have two types of objects:;
#X text 245 44 - Audio objects, f 17;
#X text 245 62 - Control objects;
#X text 67 95 Audio objects deal \, in some way \, with audio signals. In the vast majority of cases \, it will have at least one signal input or output. Audio objects end with a tilde sign (~) \, which resembles a cute and little sinusoidal wave., f 53;
#X text 105 439 message box =>;
#X text 315 439 <= number box;
#X text 76 473 control objects =>;
#X text 528 29 A great difference between audio signals and control messages is that control data is processed any time in Pd as requested. But audio signals need to have the "DSP" engine on \, and they consume CPU power even if they aren't connected to anything!, f 62;
#X text 68 180 Example of audio objects:;
#X obj 157 266 line~;
#X text 200 266 <= generate signal lines;
#X obj 157 293 dac~;
#X text 200 293 <= audio output;
#X obj 157 212 *~;
#X text 200 213 <= audio multiplication;
#X obj 157 238 osc~;
#X text 200 239 <= oscillator;
#X text 528 102 By default \, the DSP (from "digital signal processing") is off when we open Pd. Therefore \, no audio object is operational \, but control objects are. The DSP can be turned on and off in the terminal window \, via the Menu (Media => DSP On / Dsp Off) and its shortcuts. It's also possible to send a message to Pd as we'll see later., f 62;

#X text 735 447 generate a line to 0 in 1000 ms;
#X text 529 199 With the DSP On \, let's take a look at this simple patch that controls the volume of an oscillator for a fade in/out., f 62;
#X text 650 525 multiply by line values and adjust gain;
#X text 57 570 Objects usually take arguments \, which are default values. Above we have the argument of '5' for both objects \, so the incoming value gets multiplied by '5' in the [*] object and summed by '5' in the [+] object.;

#X msg 656 410 0.25 1000;
#X text 734 410 generate a line to 0.25 in 1000 ms;
#X text 40 333 In this way \, when the DSP is on \, all objects that output audio generate signal values for each sample in this given rate. For instance \, the oscillator below spits 44100 amplitude samples per second. There's also a difference between audio and control connections. Note that audio connections are thicker., f 63;
