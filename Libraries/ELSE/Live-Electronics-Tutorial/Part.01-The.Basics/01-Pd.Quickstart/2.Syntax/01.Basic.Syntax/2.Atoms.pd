#X text 40 16 Atoms in Pd are single elements of a message. An element
(or atom) can be either a float \, a symbol or a pointer. A list then
can have any arbitrary combination of these three atoms., f 61;
#X text 40 66 Most usually \, we'll deal with floats and lists of floats
in Pd. Pointers and lists of pointers are just used in the context
of Data Structures \, an advanced and rather obscure feature of Pure
Data we'll see later on., f 61;

#X text 40 130 A number atom is always a float in Pd. More specifically
\, it's a 32 bit floating point number. Even if a number is an integer
\, it is considered as a 32 bit float in Pd. All that is not in the
format of a float is considered in Pd as a symbol string. Numbers in
Pd have a display resolution of 6 digits and they are represented in
scientific notation if this resolution is exceeded. All examples below
are float atoms:, f 61;
