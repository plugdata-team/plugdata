#X text 49 29 Partitioned convolution divides the IR into smaller bits
so we get much shorter latencies suitable for live input. The convolution
is done in each partition separately.;
#X text 50 87 We can implement this in a Pd patch by loading different
instances of each partition inside [clone]. In this way \, an input
is convoluted to all partitions at the same time \, but they're delayed
accordingly so they get added at the right time.;

#X text 49 170 The [conv~] object from the ELSE library is an abstraction
that implements partitioned convolution this way. It needs a partition
size and an audio file to load as an IR. Below we load a rather bizarre
IR file: a voice sample \, also used in Pd Vanilla's example.;

#X text 524 56 The sound input in the convolution is a chaotic oscillator.
Since the IR actually sounds more like an input \, we can think of
the input as the actual IR \, since the operation is commutative (convoluting
a and B is the same as convoluting B and A). We also have an envelope
generator to control the incoming sound. As an alternative \, we also
have a sample input that you can select with [xselect~]., f 68;

#X text 71 397 This is to reinforce the idea of using convolution as
a general sound processor. It's been noted that convolution is widely
used as a reverberator \, but you can also think of it as a filter.
We'll get back to convolution when we discuss in depth filters and
reverbs \, but for now let's have fun with it in a more creative way.
