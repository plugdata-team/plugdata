#X text 33 60 The [gbuzz~] object from ELSE is based on a CSound opcode
and is a band-limited oscillator that can generate different waveforms
\, incluing a band limited impulse just like you get with [bl.osc~
imp]. This means it provides band limiting by limiting the number of
partials \, so beware that you can still generate aliasing if you have
too many partials and a high enough fundamental., f 63;
#X text 33 166 Note \, however \, that [gbuzz~] is not based on tables
generated via sum of partials. Instead \, it is based on the Discrete
Summation Formulae (DSF) technique., f 63;
#X text 33 218 DSF uses clever manipulation of trigonometry to express
the sum of an arbitrary number of cosine waves (therefore \, additive
synthesis in principle) as the quotient of two simpler signals \, making
it more efficient than a set of oscillators \, but only relevant if
the number of partials is high \, at least in this PD implementation
as an abstraction., f 63;
#X text 33 315 And just like a set of oscillators \, the convenience
of [gbuzz~] is that you can control the spectral content of components
with thespectral multiplier parameter. This parameter sets the brightness
\, the highger the value \, the more harmonic content you have., f
63;
#X text 33 396 The spectral multiplier 'm' scales each successive harmonic.
For m = 0.5 you get 1 \, 0.5 \, 0.25 \, 0.125 and so on as the amplitude
list. A factor of 1 creates an impulse like waveform. Check the help
file for more details., f 63;
