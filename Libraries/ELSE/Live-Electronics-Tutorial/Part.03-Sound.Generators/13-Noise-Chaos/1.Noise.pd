#X text 25 24 Here we have a random number generator in [expr~]. Since
the current block size is just 1 \, a new random value is output for
each sample. Initial values are from -1000 to 1000 and then divided
by 1000 to fall within the -1 to 1 range.;

#X text 27 15 We've seen oscillators \, which are "Deterministic" generators
whose output is periodic and defined by simple functions that produce
simple waveforms. A deterministic system is a system in which no randomness
is involved in the development of future states of the system and an
implication is that you can easily predict the sate of the system.
In other words \, you can easilly know the amplitude value of an oscillator
by only knowing the initial phase and current time. On the other hand
\, you have complex "indeterminate" systems that you can't predict
the future state. In other words \, it's random and unpredictable.

#X text 27 154 "Noise" is a term used in various context. It can refer
to undesired signals that are introduced in the process of recording
\, storing \, reproduction \, processing or conversion. For instance
\, when converting analog to digital you have quantization error \,
or quantization "noise". However \, "noise" also means signals with
apparent or actual lack of pattern \, periodicity or predictability
- such phenomena is known as "randomness" and can be produced by a
stochastic pattern., f 70;
#X text 27 261 Stochastic patterns are described by a random probability
distribution where you only know the probability of the occurance of
an event or value \, but you can't predict what the value is. However
\, in computers \, nothing is really "indeterminate" or "unpredictable"
\, so what we have are algorithms that produce results that seem random.
These are then called "pseudo random number generator" algorithms and
the implication is that you get the same sequence of values if the
initial state of the algorithm is determined \, that is if the first
initial value is known. Such an initial value is known as the "seed"
of the random number generator., f 70;
#X text 27 416 White noise is a famous noise type widely used in music.
It's a good source for audio testing \, filtering and modelling percussive
sounds. White noise can be implemented with a simple random number
generator \, whose probability function is 'flat' \, which means that
the probablity function is equality distributed and any value has equal
probabilities of occurances. The sound quality of white noise has energy
equally distributed over the whole spectral range (from 0 Hz to Nyquist).
Calling it white is an analogy to white light \, which is a combination
of lights of different wavelengths in the visible spectrum., f 70

#X text 571 315 The subatch below uses a random function built in [expr~]
to generate white noise. Open it and check it out.;
#X text 565 59 The native [noise~] object is a White Noise generator.
The quality of the pseudo random number generator is questioned by
Miller Pukckette himself. It is the same algorithm from the [random]
object and also found in [array random]. The 'seed' is always the same
for the first creation of this object and also the subsequent ones
\, but each gets a different seed. You can set different seeds \, which
is useful for band limited noises as we'll see later. Check its help
