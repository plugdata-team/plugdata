#X text 92 529 The [pink~] object allows you to set the number of octaves
\, where 1 makes it a single frequency band of noise \, which is plain
white noise. For each extra octave \, the bandwidth is split in half
and the new octaves are 3dB lower than the previous lower octave. The
maximum number of extra octaves is 40 and the default depends on the
sample rate \, and it is so that the lowest octave starts around 20hz
(a sample rate of 44100 gives us 12 octaves)., f 82;

#X text 92 430 [pink~] generating pink noise with the Voss-McCartney
algorithm \, where you mix a bunch of band limited white noises (we'll
see more about noise band limiting later). A frequancy band limited
noise has all frequencies withing a frequency band from 0Hz to the
bandwidth. By adding different band limitded noises with different
bandwidths you end up adding more energy in the lower range and we
do this so it decays 3dB per octave., f 82;

white noise \, pink noise has a decay of energy in the higher frequency
range. It falls about 3 dB per octave. Compare both below \, check
