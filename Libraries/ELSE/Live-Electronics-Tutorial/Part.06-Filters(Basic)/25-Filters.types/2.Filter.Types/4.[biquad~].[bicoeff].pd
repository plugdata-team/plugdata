#X text 49 24 The vanilla object [biquad~] is a general filter that
can act as several types depending on its coefficients. The "biquad"
term is an abbreviation of "biquadratic" \, since the filter is described
as a biquadratic polinomial., f 76;
#X text 49 74 This is not a friendly filter and generating coefficients
for [biquad~] is not trivial for musicians \, but the [bicoeff] object
from ELSE generates coefficients for nine filter types from Robert
Bristow-Johnson's "Cookbook formulae for audio EQ biquad filter coefficients".
All these filter types have already been presented here. The [bicoeff]
object is a GUI object and it plots the amplitude response., f 76

#X text 178 409 The range is logarithmic in MIDI pitch (horizontal
axis) and dB (vertical axis). The horizontal line is for 0 dB and the
vertical lines represent and set the bandwidth or slope (for the shelving
filters). You can click anywhere on the object to set frequency by
moving through the horizontal axis \, but if you click on the vertical
lines you can set bandwidth instead. The Y axis sets gain for 3 filter
types: "eq \, lowshelf and highshelf).;
