NAME
  aubio - a command line tool to extract information from sound files

SYNOPSIS

  aubio [-h] [-V] <command> ...

COMMANDS

  The general syntax is "aubio <command> <soundfile> [options]". The following
  commands are available:

  onset        get onset times
  pitch        extract fundamental frequency
  beat         get locations of beats
  tempo        get overall tempo in bpm
  notes        get midi-like notes
  mfcc         extract mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients
  melbands     extract mel-frequency energies per band

  For a list of available commands, use "aubio -h". For more info about each
  command, use "aubio <command> --help".

GENERAL OPTIONS

  These options can be used before any command has been specified.

  -h, --help  show help message and exit

  -V, --version  show version

COMMON OPTIONS

  The following options can be used with all commands:

  <source_uri>, -i <source_uri>, --input <source_uri>  input sound file to
  analyse (required)

  -r <freq>, --samplerate <freq>  samplerate at which the file should be
  represented (default: 0, e.g. samplerate of the input sound)

  -H <size>, --hopsize <size>  overlap size, number of samples between two
  consecutive analysis (default: 256)

  -B <size>, --bufsize <size>  buffer size, number of samples used for each
  analysis, (e.g. FFT length, default: 512)

  -h, --help  show help message and exit

  -T format, --time-format format  select time values output format (samples,
  ms, seconds) (default: seconds)

  -v, --verbose  be verbose (increment verbosity by 1, default: 1)

  -q, --quiet  be quiet (set verbosity to 0)

ONSET

  The following additional options can be used with the "onset" subcommand.

  -m <method>, --method <method>  onset novelty function
  <default|energy|hfc|complex|phase|specdiff|kl|mkl|specflux> (default:
  default)

  -t <threshold>, --threshold <threshold>  threshold (default: unset)

  -s <value>, --silence <value>  silence threshold, in dB (default: -70)

  -M <value>, --minioi <value>  minimum Inter-Onset Interval (default: 12ms)

PITCH

  The following additional options can be used with the "pitch" subcommand.

  -m <method>, --method <method>  pitch detection method
  <default|yinfft|yin|mcomb|fcomb|schmitt> (default: default, e.g. yinfft)

  -t <threshold>, --threshold <threshold>  tolerance (default: unset)

  -s <value>, --silence <value>  silence threshold, in dB (default: -70)

  The default buffer size for the beat algorithm is 2048. The default hop size
  is 256.

BEAT

  The "beat" command accepts all common options and no additional options.

  The default buffer size for the beat algorithm is 1024. The default hop size
  is 512.

TEMPO

  The "tempo" command accepts all common options and no additional options.

  The default buffer size for the beat algorithm is 1024. The default hop size
  is 512.

NOTES

  The following additional options can be used with the "notes" subcommand.

  -s <value>, --silence <value>  silence threshold, in dB (default: -70)

  -d <value>, --release-drop <value>  release drop level, in dB. If the level
  drops more than this amount since the last note started, the note will be
  turned off (default: 10).

MFCC

  The "mfcc" command accepts all common options and no additional options.

MELBANDS

  The "melbands" command accepts all common options and no additional options.

EXAMPLES

  Extract onsets using a minimum inter-onset interval of 30ms:

    aubio onset /path/to/input_file -M 30ms

  Extract pitch with method "mcomb" and a silence threshold of -90dB:

    aubio pitch /path/to/input_file -m mcomb -s -90.0

  Extract MFCC using the standard Slaney implementation:

    aubio mfcc /path/to/input_file -r 44100
