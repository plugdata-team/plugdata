NAME
  aubiomfcc - a command line tool to compute Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients

SYNOPSIS

  aubiomfcc source
  aubiomfcc [[-i] source]
            [-r rate] [-B win] [-H hop]
            [-T time-format]
            [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

  aubiomfcc compute the Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC).

  MFCCs are coefficients that make up for the mel-frequency spectrum, a
  representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound. By default, 13
  coefficients are computed using 40 filters.

  When started with an input source (-i/--input), the coefficients are given on
  the console, prefixed by their timestamps in seconds.

OPTIONS

  This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
  starting with two dashes (--). A summary of options is included below.

  -i, --input source  Run analysis on this audio file. Most uncompressed and
  compressed are supported, depending on how aubio was built.

  -r, --samplerate rate  Fetch the input source, resampled at the given
  sampling rate. The rate should be specified in Hertz as an integer. If 0,
  the sampling rate of the original source will be used. Defaults to 0.

  -B, --bufsize win  The size of the buffer to analyze, that is the length
  of the window used for spectral and temporal computations. Defaults to 512.

  -H, --hopsize hop  The number of samples between two consecutive analysis.
  Defaults to 256.

  -T, --timeformat format  Set time format (samples, ms, seconds). Defaults to
  seconds.

  -h, --help  Print a short help message and exit.

  -v, --verbose  Be verbose.

REFERENCES

  Using the default parameters, the filter coefficients will be computed
  according to Malcolm Slaney's Auditory Toolbox, available at the following
