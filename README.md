PlugData is a plugin wrapper for Pure Data, featuring a new GUI made with JUCE. This is still a WIP, and there are probably still some bugs. By default, it ships with the ELSE collection of externals and abstractions. The aim is to provide a more comfortable patching experience for a large selection of DAWs. It can also be used as a standalone replacement for pure-data.

## Installation

Linux users are advised to install PlugData using the repositories [here](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3Aplugdata&package=plugdata). In the Arch User Repository, you can use the [plugdata-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plugdata-bin) package for the latest stable version, or the [plugdata-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plugdata-git) package for the latest experimental build.

On MacOS, PlugData can also be installed through the [homebrew package](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/plugdata).

For Mac and Windows, you can find the last release in the "Releases" section on the right. If you have a GitHub account, you can also download a recent experimental build from the actions tab.

## Build

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/timothyschoen/PlugData.git
cd PlugData
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. (the generator can be specified using -G"Unix Makefiles", -G"XCode" or -G"Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64)
cmake --build .
```

**Important:**
- Please ensure that the git submodules are initialized and updated! You can use the `--recursive` option while cloning or `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the PlugData repository .
- On Linux, Juce framework requires to install dependencies, please refer to [Linux Dependencies.md](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/blob/master/docs/Linux%20Dependencies.md) and use the full command.
- The CMake build system has been tested with *Unix Makefiles*, *XCode* and *Visual Studio 16 2019*.

Not only that, but objects that weren't cloned into Cyclone also have alternatives in ELSE, see: [this](https://github.com/porres/pd-else/wiki/Cyclone-alternatives))

## Status
What works:
- Nearly complete support for pd
- Most ELSE and cyclone library objects work
- LV2, AU and VST3 formats available, tested on Windows (x64), Mac (ARM/x64) and Linux (ARM/x64)
- Receive 512 DAW parameters using the [param] abstraction
- Receive DAW playhead position, tempo and more using the [playhead] abstraction

Known issues:
- Broken ELSE objects: 
  - [oscope~]
  - [function]
  - [bicoeff]
  - [messbox]
  - [note]
  - [canvas.active]
  - [canvas.mouse]
  - [canvas.vis]
  - [canvas.zoom]
- There may still be some more bugs

## Roadmap

These are all the things I'm hoping to implement before version 0.7
I might release some smaller versions inbetween if any serious bugs are being found.

FEATURES:
- Object discovery panel: a place where all objects (with descriptions) are listed by category
- Search in patch
- Autosave

PD COMPATIBILITY:
- Fix broken objects
- Some properties are not updated in the panel when set with a message

OTHER:
- Expand documentation with more object descriptions and inlet/outlet hover messages
- Restructure build directory
- Clean up and document code
- Codesign executables for Windows
- Support for Gem and Ofelia


Please contact me if you wish to contribute, I could use some help! Bug reports are also appreciated, they help me to get to a stable version much faster.
